        <h2>Swaps</h2>
        <div class="card">
          <div class="card-body">A plain vanilla interest rate swap is the most basic and common type of interest rate derivative. There are two parties to a swap: party one receives a stream of interest payments based on a floating interest rate and pays a stream of interest payments based on a fixed rate. Party two receives a stream of fixed interest rate payments and pays a stream of floating rate payments. Both payment streams are based on the same notional principal, and the interest payments are netted. Through this exchange of cash flows, the two parties aim to reduce uncertainty and the threat of loss from changes in market interest rates.</div>

        <h2>Caps and Floors</h2>
        <div class="card bg-light text-dark">
            <div class="card-body">A company with a floating rate loan that does not want to swap to a fixed rate but does want some protection can buy an interest rate cap. The cap is set at the top rate that the borrower wishes to pay; if the market moves above that level, the owner of the cap receives periodic payments based on the difference between the cap and the market rate. The premium, which is the cost of the cap, is based on how high the protection level is above the then-current market; the interest rate futures curve; and the maturity of the cap; longer periods cost more, as there is a higher chance that it will be in the money.</div>
          </div>
          <br>
          <h2>Swaptions</h2>
          <div class="card">
            <div class="card-body">A swaption, also known as a swap option, refers to an option to enter into an interest rate swap or some other type of swap. In exchange for an options premium, the buyer gains the right but not the obligation to enter into a specified swap agreement with the issuer on a specified future date.</div>

          <h2>Callable Swaps</h2>
        <div class="card bg-light text-dark">
          <div class="card-body">A callable swap is a contract between two counterparties in which the exchange of one stream of future interest payments is exchanged for another based on a specified principal amount. These swaps usually involve the transfer of the cash flows from a fixed interest rate for the cash flows of a floating interest rate.</div>
        </div>
        <br>
        <h2>Putable Swaps</h2>
        <div class="card">
          <div class="card-body">A putable swap is a cancellable interest rate swap—containing an embedded put option—where one counterparty makes payments based on a floating rate, while the other party makes payments based on a fixed rate. The fixed-rate receiver (floating-rate payer) has the right, but not the obligation, to terminate the swap on a number of pre-determined dates prior to its expiration date.</div>
